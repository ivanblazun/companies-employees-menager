# companies-employees-menager
 App for the management of companies and their employees. MERN / CRUD.  
 There is still a lot of work to be done, but registration, JWT, login and retrieval of users, 
 companies and employees from MongoDB have been resolved at the basic level.  
 Donâ€™t consider the frontend because I just started with it.
 
 
In short, the meaning of the application will be that the user can register through his account 
and perform data administration for companies and employees of the same company.

The server is based on the express.js environment and supports routes for necessary actions such 
as registration, user login, JWT protection and other routes related to the data of companies and 
their employees.

Frontend is based on the React.js library, which will be handled by Redux State Manager.

As for the database, it was solved through MongoDb and Mongoose for object modeling.

The current stage of development is early and thus the possibility of data entry and 
manipulation is limited.

In the future, the application will also support advanced calculation functions such as 
monthly salary payments to employees based on their tax, pension or other benefits.

I also plan to introduce a graphical display of monetary inputs and outputs of companies 
(probably using google charts).
